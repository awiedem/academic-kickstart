# Biography

Andreas Wiedemann is a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow in Politics at Nuffield College, Oxford University. I study political economy and comparative politics in advanced democracies, focusing on financial markets, wealth inequality, and social policies. My current research explores the political causes and consequences of financial insecurity, household debt, and support for the welfare state.
